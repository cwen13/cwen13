## KNOWLEDGE 

I took a few programming classes in college really enjoyed them. Through out the rest of my mecanical engineering school I kept being drawn to code in some form. Only at the end of my schooling did I start to pick up python on my own. Enjoying it I picked up a few web scrapping gigs and wrote some custom programs for an employeer. While there I was recruited to extend the ERP system with VBScript. Determined to use my degree I shifted gears for obtaining my engineeering intern certificate and look again for a position in that field.

Finding a new position I once again felt the call of programming and jumped into a code camp through Case Western Reserve University by 2U. I was able to complete this course and really get a solid foundaiton of the fundamental woring parts of web developement. Following the class I secured a position with 2U as a teaching assistant for the very program I was just a student in. Since this is a part time position I continued to search for opportunities a but had not been hired yet. Feeling down I took a step back and turned my focus onto finding any job and that took my eyes of my code for a while.

With a new class of code camp students came along and got my fire burning bright. Returnig to what I love realy has affirmed how much I want a career in coding and am commited to finding a position for me to excel at. I have been diving back into buliding and technical writing to help show my abilities not just in code but also communication. 

## INTEREST 

Outside of coding I enjoy running and reading.

## COLLABORATION 

I am open to colloboration and eager to help build projects.
