# Cody Wenrich-Clegg FULL STACK DEVELOPER 

## TECHNILOGIES
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python.

## GOAL 

Secure a web development position that will challenge my past learning to push me as a develoepr.

## KNOWLEDGE 

I took a few programming classes in college and really enjoyed them. Throughout the rest of my mechanical engineering school, I was drawn to code in some form or another. Only near the end of my schooling did I start to pick up python on my own. Enjoying it allowed for me to picked up a few web scrapping gigs and wrote some custom programs for an employer. While there I was recruited to extend the ERP system with VBScript. Determined to use my degree I shifted gears for obtaining my engineering intern certificate and look again for a position in that field.

Finding a new position, I once again felt the call of programming and jumped into a code camp through Case Western Reserve University by 2U. I was able to complete this course and really get a solid foundation of the fundamental working parts of web development. Following the class, I secured a position with 2U as a teaching assistant for the very program I was just a student in. Since this is a part time position, I continued to search for opportunities but had not been hired yet. Feeling down, I took a step back and turned my focus onto finding any job and that took my eyes off my code for a while.

A new class of code camp students came along and has my passion filled. Returning to what I love really has affirmed how much I want a career in coding and am committed to finding a position for me to excel at. I have been diving back into building and technical writing to help show my abilities not just in code but also communication.

## INTEREST 

Outside of coding I enjoy running and reading.

## COLLABORATION 

I am open to collaboration and eager to help build projects.
