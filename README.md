#Cody Wenrich-Clegg , E.I.
  

##Technologies: 
 HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python 

##Goal: 
 To secure a web development position that challenges me to grow and advance towards becoming a senior developer. 

##About Me: 
 I began my journey as a self-taught Python developer, specializing in web scraping using Selenium and other HTML-based methods. My skills expanded as I learned VBScript to enhance the ERP system at my workplace, which improved data accuracy for the sales team and provided better visibility into production workloads. 

Transitioning from my role as a Quality Engineer, I moved into project management at Bendix/Knorr Bremse and enrolled in a coding bootcamp through Case Western Reserve University with 2U/edX. I excelled in the program, often assisting my peers, and subsequently secured a Teaching Assistant position where I supported another cohort of students. However, I realized that teaching did not align with my long-term career aspirations, prompting me to seek engineering roles. 

With a background in Mechanical Engineering, I took on the role of Design Engineer at a construction company, where I honed my AutoCAD and Inventor skills while gaining insights into the construction industry, specifically in ceiling suspension systems and duct support design. 

Now, I am committed to returning to development with the goal of becoming a proficient web developer and eventually transitioning into full-fledged software development. 

##Collobration: 
 I am open to collaboration and eager to contribute to project development.
